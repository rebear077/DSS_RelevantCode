To test our functionality, we simulated an NTN-TN cell around the North Pole, with a given radius. Using a Poisson Point Process (PPP), we generated coordinates for APs, satellite base stations, and ground terminals. Each terminal was assigned to its respective AP or satellite base station.

We also provided two code snippets 'ntnPriceScheme.go' and 'ntnInterferenceScheme.go' as examples to demonstrate two simple consensus-sharing scenarios.
